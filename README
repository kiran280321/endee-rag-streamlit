# 📄 AI-Powered Document Q&A System using Endee Vector Database

## 🔹 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **AI/ML application built around vector search** using **Endee** as the vector database.
The system enables **semantic search** over documents and follows a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** style workflow, exposed through an interactive **Streamlit UI**.

Users can ask natural-language questions, and the system retrieves the most relevant document content using vector similarity.

---

## 🔹 Problem Statement

Traditional keyword-based search systems fail to understand the **semantic meaning** of text. As a result, users often receive irrelevant results when searching large documents.

There is a need for systems that:

* Understand **context**, not just keywords
* Retrieve **semantically relevant information**
* Form the foundation for RAG, recommendation systems, and AI agents

## 🔹 Solution Overview

This project solves the problem by using **vector embeddings and similarity search**:

1. Documents are split into smaller text chunks
2. Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding
3. Embeddings are stored and searched using **Endee-style vector search**
4. Relevant chunks are retrieved using semantic similarity
5. Retrieved context is returned as the final answer (RAG-style retrieval)

RAG-style Answer Output
```

### Components

* **Embedding Model**: Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
* **Vector Database**: Endee (vector-search compatible layer)
* **Backend**: Python
* **UI**: Streamlit
* **Use Case**: Semantic Search + RAG

---

## 🔹 How Endee Is Used

Endee is designed as a **standalone vector database service** that stores embeddings and performs similarity-based search.

In this project:

* Endee is used as the **vector database conceptually and architecturally**
* Document embeddings are stored and searched using an **Endee-compatible vector search layer**
* The same workflow (ingestion → vector storage → semantic search) is preserved

### Note on Implementation

For demonstration and assignment purposes, an **Endee-compatible in-memory vector client** is used instead of running the native Endee service.
This preserves the **exact vector-search logic and system design**, and the vector layer can be directly replaced with a running Endee service in production.
